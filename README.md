# Knowed Issues

## Android 11 and 12 is not working: 
With the privacy updates they change the rules to access to those folders, so now is not working propertly in those platform.

## Bulk delete is not really deleting well: 
On saved status if you press for 2 seconds, the bulk delete its enabled, but, apparently it work, it remove it from the screen, but, when you close the app, the deleted status are still there.

## When a video is saved or shared it creates a picture for the watermark, but it doesn't be deleted: 
This problem can be solved only by removing the watermark signal, but, will be great to solve the correct deletion of this issue. (In Production Version the AddWatermark method was disabled)

## Notifications are not working
There's a configuration of a reminder that is supposed to be executed daily, on production is not working but on debug mode yes

# Feature wanted

## Floating button to download
I want a floating button than if I am seen the status from my friend I hit it and immediately start the download of that status.
