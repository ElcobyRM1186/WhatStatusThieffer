# Knowed Issues

## Bulk delete is not really deleting well: 
On saved status if you press for 2 seconds, the bulk delete its enabled, but, apparently it work, it remove it from the screen, but, when you close the app, the deleted status are still there.

## Notifications are not working
There's a configuration of a reminder that is supposed to be executed daily, on production is not working but on debug mode yes

# Feature wanted

I want a floating button than if I am seen the status from my friend I hit it and immediately start the download of that status.
